# Professional Portfolio
Thanks for taking a look at my portfolio site! This project began as an early assignment for the web development bootcamp at the University of Oregon. The basic layout and styling is based on Bootstrap and I hope to continue updating this site with new content as I progress through the program and establish myself as a talented and creative developer.
